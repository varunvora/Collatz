# Collatz
Verifying collatz conjecture for large integers
<p>
The program stores calculated values in dictionary for efficiency, i.e. to prevent repititive calculation
</p>
<p>
The dictionary is stored in a different file, so that while running the program again, we can use previously calculated values
